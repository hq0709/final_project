Security Report (security.txt)
================================

Password Storage Strategy
-------------------------
We use **BCrypt** (via Spring Security components) to securely hash and Salt user passwords before storage.

1. **Algorithm**: BCrypt
   - It is a slow hashing algorithm designed to be resistant to brute-force and rainbow table attacks.
   - It automatically handles salt generation and embedding.

2. **Implementation**:
   - Class: `com.gamehub.util.PasswordUtil` (or equivalent used in `UserService`)
   - Method: `BCrypt.hashpw(password, BCrypt.gensalt(12))`
   - Work Factor: 12 (Adjustable for security/performance trade-off)

3. **Database Storage**:
   - Column: `password_hash` in `USER` table.
   - Type: `VARCHAR(255)`
   - We NEVER store plain text passwords.

4. **Verification**:
   - When a user logs in, we use `BCrypt.checkpw(candidate_password, stored_hash)` to verify the credential without ever decrypting the hash (checking is one-way).

Risk Mitigation
---------------
- **SQL Injection**: We use `JdbcTemplate` with **Prepared Statements** (placeholder `?` syntax) for all parameterized queries. This prevents malicious SQL injection attacks.
- **XSS**: Inputs are sanitized, and the frontend (React) escapes content by default.

Data Generation Strategy
------------------------
To ensure a realistic and high-volume dataset for the GameHub platform, we implemented a sophisticated AI-driven data generation pipeline.

## Review Generation (AI Powered)

Unlike traditional methods that use random string templates (CFG), we developed a custom Python script (`scripts/generate_massive_reviews.py`) that leverages the **OpenAI GPT-4o API** (or compatible LLM) to generate reviews.

### Features:
1.  **Persona System**: The script simulates diversity by randomly assigning one of 7 distinct user personas to each review, including:
    - "The Lore Archaeologist" (Story-focused)
    - "The Performance Purist" (Tech-focused)
    - "The Steam Deck User" (Handheld experience)
    - "The Casual Dad/Mom" (Accessible gameplay)
    - "The Refund Rager" (Negative bias)

2.  **Context Aware**: The prompts inject specific game titles (e.g., "Elden Ring", "Cyberpunk 2077") so the AI generates factually relevant content about mechanics, characters, and performance issues specific to that game.

3.  **Dynamic Metadata**:
    - **Rating**: Aligned with the persona's bias (e.g., Refund Rager gives 1-star).
    - **Dates**: Randomized distribution over the last 365 days.
    - **Engagement**: Synthesized 'helpful' and 'likes' counts using exponential distribution to mimic real social proof.

This approach resulted in **1300+ high-quality, non-repetitive reviews** that provide a rich user experience.

4.  **Data Persistence**:
    - **Base Data**: Extracted from `submission/base_data.sql` (Static game/platform info).
    - **AI Reviews**: Generated into `submission/premium_reviews.sql`.
    - **Final Dataset**: Merged into `submission/data.sql` using `scripts/reconstruct_final.py`.

## User Generation
We generated **100+ unique user profiles** (`User_1001` to `User_1100`) with:
- Consistent writing styles matching their persona.
- Realistic display names and email addresses.
- Hashed passwords (`demo123` equivalent) for security compliance.

## Database Schema
The data is structured in a relational MySQL database comprising:
- `GAME`: Core game metadata.
- `USER`: User accounts and profiles.
- `REVIEW`: Text reviews and ratings.
- `REVIEW_LIKE`: Social interactions.
- `PLATFORM`, `GENRE`: Reference tables.

For full schema details, see `submission/ddl.sql`.
